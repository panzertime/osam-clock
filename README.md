# O.S. Anno Mundi Clock

I wanted to learn how to do some GUI / windowing without resorting to Java Swing or Electron. I've been forced into Python by ye olde Circumstances, and Tk seemed like a good option. So I made a little clock that displays the current date in Old Style (i.e. Julian date) with the Orthodox Anno Mundi era (i.e. counting years since the Creation, a little over 7500 years ago).

Bon appetit!
